input/contact pins:
    -pin: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
button pins:
    -start button: 11
led pins:
    -resetLED: 12, 

hand seals: binary
combination: String Arrays

code:
- Wait for start button:
- Loop through every contact pin until a pin is activated.
    -delay //the time it takes for every contact to be pressed.
- Create several if() statements for each pin:
    -inside each if() statement create/mold the byte with bitwise operator << .
- Go through for() loop:
    -go through switch() case to create a String() jutsu[] array.
    -compare jutsu[] array element with elements of other arrays.
    -if a jutsu[] element doesn't match with an array element, define the 
     compareBool variable as false.
    -if a jutsu[] element has matched with another array element where the for
     loop n is same as the compared arrays length+1, then execute the arrays' function
