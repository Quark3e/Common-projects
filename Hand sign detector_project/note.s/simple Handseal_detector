input/contact pins:
    -pin: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
button pins:
    -start button: 10, 
led pins:
    -resetLED: 12, testLED: 13, 

hand seals: byte variable
combination: String Arrays

Functions:
- Byte function: Read contact pins and create each byte "profile"
  with several if() statements and bitwise operators. 
  Parameters: None
  Return: a byte variable
- Array function: Edit global "jutsu[]" array with byte parameter
  using switch case statements.
  Parameters: byte variable, integer
  Return: 0
- Boolean function (multiple separate functions for each
  existing jutsu): Compares jutsu[] array with *one* existing array
  by comparing elements in both arrays with a for loop and changing a local
  boolean value (with default: "true", but "false" if an element doesn't match).
  The for loops iteration counter is the length of array, starting at 0.
  Parameters: None
  Return: the local boolean value

code:
- Wait for start button:
- Loop through every contact pin until a pin is activated.
    -delay //the time it takes for every contact to be pressed.
- Create several if() statements for each pin:
    -inside each if() statement create/mold the byte with bitwise operator << .
- Go through for() loop:
    -go through switch() case to create a String() jutsu[] array.
    -compare jutsu[] array element with elements of other arrays.
    -if a jutsu[] element doesn't match with an array element, define the 
     compareBool variable as false.
    -if a jutsu[] element has matched with another array element where the for
     loop n is same as the compared arrays length+1, then execute the arrays' function
