Ideas:
- Deployable mask (mechanics)
    - google glasses integrated HUD display
    - might need deployable support from "neck bottom part"
      for the mask to stay snug on the face. Otherwise a band
- Location sensing robot arm assistant (video image tracking (/servo))
- Ignition v2.0: Simpler version
    - use solenoid actuator instead of servo motor
    - connect all to one button instead of using a noice sensor. Not as
      advanced, but hey. This version could fit in your pocket so don't complain.
